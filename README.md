# Klint and Hooper Algorithmic Art

## Overview
I was inspired to make this [algorithmic art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_art) (algo art) from the pioneering works of [Wassily Kandinsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wassily_Kandinsky) and [Hilma af Klint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilma_af_Klint). My JavaScript-based project uses the p5.js library to dynamically generate artwork that captures the essence of abstract paintings with a modern twist. The algorithmic approach to creating art not only pays homage to the masters of abstract painting but also explores the possibilities that emerge when art intersects with technology.

## Visual Description 
In the animation, colorful shapes are scattered on the canvas that gives the viewer the impression that they are viewing a 2D plane, but once the canvas is populated with shapes, the viewer can see that the shapes are actually 3D objects. The point of view rotates to reveal that the shapes have variable depth, occupy 3D space, 

## Conceptual Inspiration
The colors and shapes are inspired by the works of Kandinsky and af Klint, who were known for their use of [vibrant colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilma_af_Klint#/media/File:Hilma_af_Klint_-_Group_IX_UW_No._25,_The_Dove,_No._1_(13912).jpg) and [geometric forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wassily_Kandinsky#/media/File:Vassily_Kandinsky,_1923_-_On_White_II.jpg). It is a testament to the enduring influence of their artistry and an exploration of how their visionary approaches to abstraction can be reinterpreted in the digital age.

## Technical Overview
This project can run directly on any web browser, making it accessible and easy to share. The code is written in JavaScript and utilizes the p5.js library, which simplifies the process of creating graphics and interactive content. Like most algo art, randomness is a core component in the creation of the visuals. Randomness controls the size, color, shape type, and the position of the shapes, creating a unique experience each time the animation is run. The code is designed to be modular, allowing for easy customization and experimentation with different parameters.
